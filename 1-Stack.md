# Stacks: A Comprehensive Guide

## Introduction
In the realm of computer science and programming, data structures play a crucial role in organizing and managing data efficiently. One such fundamental data structure is the **stack**. In this guide, we'll cover all the overall aspects of the concpet of stacks and what they do. Their functionality and their use in the coding world. 


## Overview
A stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last In, First Out principle. Think of it as a stack of plates where the last plate placed on the stack is the first one to be removed. Stacks find applications in various aspects of coding such as expression evaluation, function call management, undo mechanisms, and more. Think of it like a program manager almost. 

## Docmentation Definition
A stack is a collection of elements with two primary operations: **push** to add elements to the top of the stack, and **pop** to remove the topmost element from the stack. When it comes to coding, common language is used as to add familiarity to concepts within this otherwise very complex owrld. 

## Operations

## Push 
The `Push` operation adds an element to the top of the stack.
```csharp
public void Push(int item)
{
    stackArray[++top] = item;
}
```
## Pop 
The Pop operation removes and returns the topmost element from the stack.

```csharp
public int Pop()
{
    if (IsEmpty())
        throw new InvalidOperationException("Stack is empty");
        
    return stackArray[top--];
}
```
## Peek 
The Peek operation returns the topmost element from the stack without removing it.

```csharp
public int Peek()
{
    if (IsEmpty())
        throw new InvalidOperationException("Stack is empty");

    return stackArray[top];
}
```
## IsEmpty 
The IsEmpty operation checks if the stack is empty. One of its basic commands

```csharp
public bool IsEmpty()
{
    return top == -1;
}
```
## Additional Info
Stacks can also be implemented using arrays. Here's a C# example:

```csharp
public class Stack
{
    private int[] stackArray;
    private int top;

    public Stack(int size)
    {
        stackArray = new int[size];
        top = -1;
    }

    // Implement push, pop, peek, and IsEmpty methods here...
}
```
## Applications

Expression Evaluation: Used in evaluating arithmetic expressions.
Function Call Management: Used to store function call information in recursion.
Undo Mechanisms: Utilized to implement undo functionality in text editors.
Browser History: Stacks can be employed to maintain browsing history.

## Conclusion

Stacks are indispensable data structures in computer science, providing a simple yet powerful way to manage data. Understanding their concepts, operations, and implementations is essential for every programmer. By mastering stacks, you gain valuable insights into efficient data management and problem-solving strategies.

This guide aims to serve as a comprehensive resource for anyone seeking to deepen their understanding of stacks and their applications in programming. Happy coding!
